# Fix for 500 Internal Server Error

## âœ… **Issue Identified**
The error was caused by the missing `fruitcake/laravel-cors` package on the server:
```
Class "Fruitcake\Cors\HandleCors" does not exist
```

## ðŸ”§ **Solution Applied**

### 1. **Removed CORS Package Dependency**
- Removed `\Fruitcake\Cors\HandleCors::class` from `bootstrap/app.php`
- Deleted `config/cors.php` file
- No external CORS package needed

### 2. **Added Manual CORS Headers**
- Added CORS headers directly to API responses in `ClientIntegrationController`
- Headers added to all response objects:
  - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
  - `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS`
  - `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization, X-Requested-With`

### 3. **Files Modified**
- `bootstrap/app.php` - Removed CORS middleware dependency
- `app/Http/Controllers/ClientIntegrationController.php` - Added CORS headers to responses
- `config/cors.php` - Deleted (no longer needed)

## ðŸš€ **How to Deploy**

1. **Upload the modified files to your server:**
   ```bash
   # Upload these files to your server:
   - bootstrap/app.php
   - app/Http/Controllers/ClientIntegrationController.php
   ```

2. **Clear Laravel cache:**
   ```bash
   php artisan config:clear
   php artisan cache:clear
   php artisan route:clear
   ```

3. **Test the API endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://dashboard.mediasolution.io/api/charge/create-tap \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"amount": 10, "currency": "JOD"}'
   ```

## âœ… **Expected Result**
- No more 500 Internal Server Error
- API endpoint returns proper JSON responses
- CORS headers are included in responses
- Frontend can successfully call the API

The 500 error should now be resolved! ðŸŽ‰
